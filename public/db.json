During his time in Fnatic, he had been resting due to a wrist injury and was unable to play for his team - the news first came around in March of 2016 but Olof went inactive temporarily in April of 2016. Niclas 'PlesseN' Plessen stood in for Olof for the majority of that time, before John 'wenton' Eriksson was later picked up as a stand-in. Fnatic announced his return to the team roster in June 2016, as Olof was fit to play again. His tenure there lasted until August 2017, when he was picked up by FaZe Clan. In April 2018, he took a personal leave of absence and was benched for a month. Due to personal issues, he was benched again in June 2018 and returned a month later."

After a ten month tenure in Fnatic he was cut and joined the Second Swedish FlipSid3 Tactics roster along with fellow Swedish player twist. The team was later picked up by Team Property. After four months of mixed results, Team Property dropped the team resulting in the team go under the 1337 name. Znajder would later join the MSL run Dignitas in place of Nico. After only a month he was cut from Dignitas after which he would go on to stand in for Hellraisers. In January 2016, Hellraisers would release him of his services after which he would again link up with former In-game leader Pronax in Team Ancient. They would go on to join the player-owned organization GODSENT. After 19 months at GODSENT, including a 3rd-4th finish at DreamHack Masters Malmö 2016 and an underwhelming group stage exit at the ELEAGUE Major: Atlanta 2017, his time with GODSENT would come to an end and he would be released from the team."
